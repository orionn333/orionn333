- 👋 Hi, I’m Anael González Paz
- 👀 I’m interested in FOSS projects.
- 💙 I like to code in my spare time and I love Linux 🐧.
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to develop apps for Android in kotlin.
- 🔧 I’d developed some applications using the Qt framework in C++,
  though I’m far from being an expert programmer.  
  I’m trying my best to improve my code skills by creating some projects for my personal use,
  or even for people who asked me for some application for their use.
  I’m also interested in web design, and I have significantly improved
  my CSS skills over the past years.
  
- ⌛ I hope I’ll soon be able to spend more time on coding and on making
    better contributions, but I don't have enough time by now.  
    This means that I won't be an active user, at least for now.
